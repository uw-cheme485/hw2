## Problem 1 (11.1) Design heuristics

For the ethylbenzene process shown in Appendix B, check the design specifications for the following three pieces of equipment against the appropriate heuristics: P-301, V-302, T-302. Comment on any significant differences you find.

## Problem 2 (11.3) Design heuristics

For the drying oil process shown in Appendix B, check the design specifications for the following three pieces of equipment against the appropriate heuristics: V-501, P-501, H-501. Comment on any significant differences that you find.

## Problem 3 (7.13) Vessel costs

When designing equipment for high-temperature and high-pressure service, the maximum allowable stress as a function of temperature of the material of construction is of great importance. Consider a cylindrical vessel shell that is to be designed for pressure of 150 bar (design pressure). The diameter of the vessel is 3.2 m, it is 15 m long, and a corrosion allowance of 6.35 mm (1/4") is to be used. Construct a table that shows the thickness of the vessel walls in the temperature range of 300 to 500C (in 20C increments) if the materials of construction are (a) ASME SA515-grade carbon steel and (b) ASME SA-240-grade 316 stainless steel.

## Problem 4 (7.14) Vessel costs

Using the results from Problem 3, determine the relative costs of the vessel using the two materials of construction (CS and 316 SS) over the temperature range. You may assume that the cost of the vessel is directly proportional to the weight of the vessel and that the 316 SS costs 3.0 times as much as CS. Based on these results, which material of construction is favored over the temperature range 300-500C for this vessel?

## Problem 5 (7.16) Estimation of individual piece of equipment

Determine the bare module cost of a 1-shell-pass, 2-tube-pass (1-2) heat exchanger designed for the following operating conditions:

Maximum operating pressure (tube side) = 30 barg <br>
Maximum operating pressure (shell side) = 5 barg <br>
Process fluid in tubes requires stainless steel MOC <br>
Shell-side utility (cooling water) requires carbon steel MOC <br>
Heat exchange area = 160 m^2

## Problem 6 (7.26) Estimation of entire plant

Determine the bare module, total module, and grassroots cost of the ethylene oxide plant described in Appendix B, Project B.6.
